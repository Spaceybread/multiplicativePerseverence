# Multiplicative persistence

According to Wikipedia, 'the persistence of a number is the number of times one must apply a given operation to an integer before reaching a fixed point at which the operation no longer alters the number.'

I adapted this code by Matt Parker (from Stand-up Maths on Youtube) to better find numers with multiplicative persistence of 'n' or higher. I have personally run this script to find numbers with persistence upto 8, but after that, my machine gives up. 

If you want to experiment with different values for n, change the value following the greater that sign (>) near the end of the defined function to n - 1. 

Cool? Cool.
